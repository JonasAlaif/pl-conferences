POPL 2024 Call for Papers

PACMPL Issue POPL 2024 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming
languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical.
Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue POPL 2024 will be invited to
present their work in the POPL conference in January 2024, which is
sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG.

Scope

Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion
of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both
theoretical and experimental papers are welcome. We seek submissions
that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design,
understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.

Evaluation Criteria

The Program Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each
submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general
POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality,
relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its
scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying
what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and
comparing it with previous work. Advice on writing technical papers can
be found on the SIGPLAN author information page.

Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly
enforced.

Full Double-Blind Reviewing Process

POPL 2024 will use a full double-blind reviewing process (similar to the
one used for POPL 2023 but different from the lightweight double-blind
process used in previous years). This means that identities of authors
will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance
decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted
papers. The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences
for authors.

-   Submissions: Authors must omit their names and institutions from
    their paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own
    prior work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our
    previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

-   Supplementary material: Authors are permitted to provide
    supplementary material (e.g., detailed proofs, proof scripts, system
    implementations, or experimental data) along with their submission,
    which reviewers may (but are not required to) examine. This material
    may take the form of a single file, such as a PDF or a tarball.
    Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary material. Links to
    supplementary material on external websites are not permitted.

-   Author response: In responding to reviews, authors should not say
    anything that reveals their identity, since author identities will
    not be revealed to reviewers at that stage of the reviewing process.

-   Dissemination of work under submission: Authors are welcome to
    disseminate their ideas and post draft versions of their paper(s) on
    their personal website, institutional repository, or arXiv
    (reviewers will be asked to turn off arXiv notifications during the
    review period). But authors should not take steps that would almost
    certainly reveal their identities to members of the Program
    Committee, e.g., directly contacting PC members or publicizing the
    work on widely-visible social media or major mailing lists used by
    the community.

The purpose of the above restrictions is to help the Program Committee
and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias,
not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors’ identities
if they were to try. In particular, nothing should be done in the name
of anonymity that weakens the quality of the submission.

However, there are occasionally cases where adhering to the above
restrictions is truly difficult or impossible for one reason or another.
In such cases, the authors should contact the Program Chair to discuss
the situation and how to handle it.

The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing addresses many common scenarios and
answers many common questions about this topic. But there remain many
grey areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret
the double-blind rules or you encounter a complex case that is not
clearly covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chair for
guidance.

Additional Details of the Reviewing Process

POPL 2024 will have four Associate Chairs who will help the Program
Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions
when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate
reviewer discussions.

As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to
reviews, as indicated in the Important Dates table. Responses are
optional but recommended. A response should address specific points or
questions raised in the reviews as well as any erroneous claims made by
reviewers; in particular, it should not present new technical results,
unless specifically requested by the reviewers.

The Program Committee (PC) will discuss papers electronically using the
HotCRP conference management system. There will be no physical or
synchronous PC meeting; this will avoid the time, cost, and
environmental impact of transporting an increasingly large committee to
one point on the globe. There is also no formal External Program
Committee or Extended Review Committee, though experts outside the
committee will be consulted as needed. Paper decisions will be
accompanied by a “meta-review” summarizing the reasoning behind the
committee’s decision.

To conform with ACM requirements for journal publication, all POPL
papers will be subject to two rounds of review. At the end of the first
round, the PC will select a set of conditionally accepted papers, each
with a clear list of mandatory revisions that the authors must implement
in order for the paper to be accepted. For the second round, authors of
conditionally accepted papers will then be required to submit a short
description of how they have revised the paper, including how the
mandatory revisions have been implemented. The PC will then check the
revisions and make final acceptance decisions. Authors of conditionally
accepted papers must submit a satisfactory revision to the PC by the
second-round deadline or risk rejection.

For additional information about the reviewing process, see: Principles
of POPL, a presentation of the underlying organizational and reviewing
policies for POPL. For POPL 2024, policies specified in this Call for
Papers supersede those in the Principles of POPL document.

Submission Site Information

The submission site is https://popl24.hotcrp.com.

Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last
submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The
submission site requires entering author names and affiliations,
relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors
after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Program
Chair (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of
eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).

The submission deadline is 11:59 PM on July 11, 2023, Anywhere on Earth:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth

Conflicts of Interest

For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly
declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of
that submission. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as “Other
Conflicts (external)”. A conflict caught late in the reviewing process
leads to a voided review which may be infeasible to replace.

Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g.,
Ph.D., post-doc; forever), between an author and a co-author (papers and
proposals; for two years), between people at the same institution
(branches of large companies or different locations of research
institutes are considered to be the same institution; for two years
after leaving an institution), between people with financial conflicts
of interest, and between relatives.

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are
especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so
spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about
a conflict, please ask the Program Chair.

Submission Guidelines

Prior to the paper submission deadline, authors should upload their full
anonymized paper. Here are some key requirements concerning paper
submissions:

-   Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding
    bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the acmart
    LaTeX class with acmsmall option). It is a single-column page layout
    with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent
    POPL page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in
    (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different
    format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for
    summary rejection. The PACMPL template for LaTeX can be found at the
    SIGPLAN author information page, and further information about
    PACMPL submissions can be found on the PACMPL author guidelines
    page. PACMPL does not support submissions in Microsoft Word.

-   We strongly encourage use of the review and screen options in order
    to make submissions easier to review.

-   We strongly encourage use of author-year citations, since that is
    the citation format required by PACMPL for final versions of
    accepted papers.

-   Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4
    paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple
    times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before
    the deadline will be the version reviewed.

-   Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and
    the ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent paper submissions to other
    conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication
    are not allowed.

-   Authors are free to submit supplementary material along with their
    submissions, but it must be fully anonymized.

-   Authors must list all their conflicts of interest (both PC conflicts
    and external conflicts) in the HotCRP submission form.

-   Authors may include additional information in a field of the HotCRP
    submission form labeled “Confidential Comments for the Program
    Chair”. This information need not be anonymized. It can be used to
    inform the Program Chair, for example, about sensitive issues
    concerning a conflict with a PC member or about supplementary
    material that cannot be anonymized. It is left to the discretion of
    the Program Chair what to do with this information.

-   If for some reason an author feels uncomfortable discussing a
    sensitive issue with the Program Chair (or communicating via the
    “Confidential Comments” field in HotCRP), they should feel free to
    get in touch instead with any of the Associate Chairs, with whom
    they can discuss the issue in confidence.

-   Submissions from PC members (except the Program Chair) are permitted
    and will not be handled any differently than other submissions. This
    is in accordance with a recent change in policy approved by the
    SIGPLAN Executive Committee: SIGPLAN conferences that use full
    double-blind review and whose PCs have at least 50 members need not
    hold PC submissions to a higher standard.

Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally
submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact
Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how
the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact
submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence
the final decision regarding the papers. Papers that go through the
Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval
printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers are
encouraged to make these materials publicly available upon publication
of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM
Digital Library.

Copyright, Publication, and Presentation

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making
peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access
and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open
access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International (CC BY) license, which grants readers liberal (re-)use
rights.

Authors of accepted papers will be required to choose one of the
following publication rights:

-   Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains
    copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to
    publish (suggested choice).
-   Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive
    permission to publish license.
-   Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive
    permission to publish license.
-   Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights,
corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask
authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the
article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required
for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models
for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in
the long-term while reducing short-term risk.

All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will
have the option of including supplementary material with their paper.
The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made
available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks
prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date
affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

Authors of accepted papers will be given the opportunity to present
their work at the conference in the form of a short talk. It is
recommended that they give a talk in person at the conference, so that
everyone can get the most out of the conference experience. However,
authors who cannot attend in person will be provided with some option
for remote presentation, as well as some mechanism for remote
interaction with conference participants. All presenting authors will be
required to register for the conference. Authors also have the option of
not presenting their work at the conference, in which case they do not
need to register.

Distinguished Paper Awards

At most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2024 will be designated as
Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Program
Committee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their
relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The selection of the
distinguished papers will be made based on the final version of the
paper and through an additional review process.

FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing

General

Q: Why are you using double-blind reviewing?

A: Studies have shown that a reviewer’s attitude toward a submission may
be affected, even unconsciously, by the identity of the authors. We want
reviewers to be able to approach each submission without any such,
possibly involuntary, pre-judgment. Many computer science conferences
have embraced double-blind reviewing. POPL has used double-blind
reviewing for several years now as stipulated in the Principles of POPL.

Q: Why are you using full double-blind reviewing instead of lightweight
double-blind reviewing?

A: For about a decade, POPL used lightweight double-blind review
(double-blind until PC members submit reviews). For POPL 2023, the
conference switched to full double-blind review (double-blind until
conditional acceptance). There are benefits and drawbacks to both
approaches, but based on our experience so far, the benefits of
full-double blind seem to outweight the drawbacks.

Q: Do you really think blinding actually works? I suspect reviewers can
often guess who the authors are anyway.

A: It is relatively rare for authorship to be guessed correctly, even by
expert reviewers, as detailed in this study.

Q: Couldn’t blind submission create an injustice where a paper is
inappropriately rejected based upon supposedly-prior work which was
actually by the same authors and not previously published?

A: Yes, but we have mechanisms in place to prevent such an injustice
from occurring. Reviewers are held accountable for their positions and
are required to identify any supposed prior work that they believe
undermines the novelty of the paper. Any assertion that “this has been
done before” by reviewers should be supported with concrete information.
The author response mechanism exists in part to hold reviewers
accountable for claims that may be incorrect. Moreover, if authors
believe that their paper is being misjudged due to the constraints of
double-blind review, they should feel free to get in touch with the
Program Chair.

For authors

Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?

A: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity
undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate
your submission without having to know who you are. The specific
guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit authors’ names
from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in
the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked
on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier
work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004],” you might say “We extend
Smith’s [2004] earlier work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure
not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity,
and avoid revealing the institutional affiliation of authors or at which
the work was performed.

If you believe for some reason that it is impossible to anonymize your
paper without significantly weakening it, please feel free to get in
touch with the Program Chair to discuss the situation.

Q: I would like to provide supplementary material for consideration,
e.g., the code of my implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do
this?

A (and also see the next question): On the submission site there will be
an option to submit supplementary material along with your main paper.
This supplementary material should also be anonymized; it may be viewed
by reviewers during the review period, so it should adhere to the same
double-blind guidelines. Please do not provide supplementary materials
via links to external web sites. It is possible to change the linked
items after the submission deadline has passed, and, to be fair to all
authors, we would like to be sure reviewers evaluate materials that have
been completed prior to the submission deadline.

Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository or I
would like to provide a link to an online demo. How do I deal with this?

A: Authors should not submit links to public repositories as
supplementary material. In general, most code in a public repository can
be repackaged and anonymized and submitted as a tarball at the time of
paper submission. (Note: it is only necessary to anonymize new code that
is part of the contribution of the paper, not pre-existing code or
libraries on which one is building.)

However, there may be cases where this anonymization is for some reason
difficult or impossible. In that case, authors should explain this in
the “Confidential Comments for the Program Chair” field of their
submission and include the link to a public repository there. The
Program Chair and Associate Chairs will then decide (on a case-by-case
basis) whether it is appropriate to share this link with reviewers.
Needless to say, attempting to discover the reviewers for your paper by
tracking visitors to a public repository would constitute a breach of
academic integrity.

The same goes for online demos. A link to an online demo should only be
given in the Confidential Comments for the Program Chair.

Q: I am building on my own past work on the WizWoz system. Do I need to
rename this system in my paper for purposes of anonymity, so as to
remove the implied connection between my authorship of past work on this
system and my present submission?

A: No. The relationship between systems and authors changes over time,
so there will be at least some doubt about authorship. Increasing this
doubt by changing the system name would help with anonymity, but it
would compromise the research process. In particular, changing the name
requires explaining a lot about the system again because you can’t just
refer to the existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing
these papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing
system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also confusing
for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X and then have the
name be changed to Name Y. Will all the reviewers go and re-read the
final version with the correct name? If not, they have the wrong name in
their heads, which could be harmful in the long run.

Q: I am submitting a paper that extends my own work that previously
appeared at a workshop. Should I anonymize any reference to that prior
work?

A: If the previous workshop publication resulted in a published paper,
then your POPL submission will be judged on the significance of its
delta with respect to that earlier paper. In that case, you should
definitely cite the earlier paper as you would any other paper (i.e., in
the third person, not revealing that you were the author of the earlier
paper) and explain the delta. If, on the other hand, the work presented
at an earlier workshop was not accompanied by a proper publication
(e.g., if it was just a talk), then your POPL submission may very well
have significant overlap with it and citing the workshop work would
effectively unblind your paper. In such a case, it is not necessary to
cite the earlier presentation. Instead, please mention it in the
“Confidential Comments for the Program Chair” field of the HotCRP form
so that the Program Chair is aware of the situation. When in doubt, ask
the Program Chair for guidance.

Q: I want to cite some related work that itself cites an earlier version
of my paper/system that appeared previously online. But that would
effectively unblind my submission. What do I do?

A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the
Program Chair for guidance.

Q: My submission presents a technique that I employed in the development
of previous papers but which was never properly described in those
papers. If I mention that my technique was used in those previous
papers, I am effectively unblinding my submission, but if I don’t
mention it, reviewers may think I am ripping off my own prior work. What
do I do?

A: It is difficult to give a general answer to this question. Ask the
Program Chair for guidance.

Q: Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded) paper on my web page? Can I
advertise the unblinded version of my paper on mailing lists or send it
to colleagues? Can I give a talk about my work while it is under review?
How do I handle social media? What about arXiv?

A: We have developed guidelines, described here, to help everyone
navigate in the same way the tension between (1) the normal
communication of scientific results, which double-blind reviewing should
not impede, and (2) actions that essentially force potential reviewers
to learn the identity of the authors for a submission. Roughly speaking,
you may (of course!) discuss work under submission, but you should not
broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your
reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs; we cannot
describe every possible scenario.

Things you may do:

-   Submit your paper to POPL, even if a previous version of it – under
    the same title or a different title – has been presented at an
    informal workshop, published on arXiv, or submitted to a previous
    conference or workshop.
-   Post your submission on your home page, your institutional
    repository, or arXiv, before or after the deadline (under whatever
    title you want).
-   Discuss your work with anyone who is not on the PC, or with PC
    members with whom you already have a conflict.
-   Present your work at professional meetings, informal workshops, or
    job interviews during the POPL review period.

The above is not an exhaustive list: when in doubt, ask the Program
Chair.

Things you should not do:

-   Contact PC members (with whom you are not conflicted) about your
    work.
-   Publicize your work on major mailing lists used by the community
    (because potential reviewers likely read these lists).
-   Publicize your work on social media if wide public [re-]propagation
    is common (e.g., Twitter) and therefore likely to reach potential
    reviewers. For example, on Facebook, a post with a broad privacy
    setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, POPL paper in, time
    to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title
    is not appropriate. Alternately, a post to a group including only
    the colleagues at your institution is fine.

Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your
paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your
authorship information to them. If you are unsure about what constitutes
“going out of your way”, please contact the Program Chair.

Q: Will the fact that POPL is double-blind have an impact on handling
conflicts-of-interest?

A: Double-blind reviewing does not change the principle that reviewers
should not review papers with which they have a conflict of interest,
even if they do not immediately know who the authors are. Authors
declare conflicts of interest when submitting their papers using the
guidelines in the call for papers. Papers will not be assigned to
reviewers who have a conflict.

For reviewers

Q: What should I do if I learn the authors’ identity? What should I do
if a prospective POPL author contacts me and asks to visit my
institution?

A: You should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from other
reviewing. In particular, as explained above, it is fine for authors to
give talks about their work (at workshops, job interviews, etc.), they
cannot control who will attend their talks, and you as a PC member
should not feel that you are prevented from attending their talks.
Knowing (for whatever reason) that a paper was written by a certain
author does not prevent you from reviewing the paper.

That said, if you feel that the authors’ actions are in flagrant
violation of double-blind review, that is a point of concern. For
example, if an author e-mails you their brand new POPL submission and
asks to visit your institution to discuss it, that would clearly not be
appropriate. There is a grey zone here, so use your best judgment, and
when in doubt, ask the Program Chair how to proceed.

Q: The authors have provided a URL to supplemental material. I would
like to see the material but I worry they will snoop my IP address and
learn my identity. What should I do?

A: As explained above, authors should not do this. If you discover that
they have done so, please bring it to the attention of the Program
Chair.

Q: If I am assigned a paper for which I feel I am not an expert, how do
I seek an outside review?

A: PC members should do their own reviews, not delegate them to someone
else. If doing so is problematic for some papers, e.g., you don’t feel
completely qualified to review them, or if you know someone who would be
the perfect reviewer for the paper, then bring this to the attention of
the Associate Chair handling your paper, and discuss with them potential
external reviewers (or other PC members) who might be able to provide an
expert review. Then, submit a review for the paper that is as careful as
possible, pointing out the areas where you think your knowledge is
lacking. The Associate Chairs will manage the process of ensuring that
papers receive sufficient expert reviews; please do not contact outside
reviewers yourself.

Q: How do we handle potential conflicts of interest since I cannot see
the author names?

A: The conference review system will ask that you identify conflicts of
interest when you get an account on the submission system. It is
critical that you enter these at least a week before the POPL submission
deadline. Feel free to also identify additional authors whose papers you
feel you could not review fairly for reasons other than those given
(e.g., strong personal friendship).

Q: How should I avoid learning the authors’ identity if I am using
web-search in the process of performing my review?

A: You should make a good-faith effort not to find the authors’ identity
during the review period, but if you inadvertently do so, this does not
disqualify you from reviewing the paper. As part of the good-faith
effort, avoid using search engines with terms like the paper’s title or
the name of a new system being discussed.

These guidelines are largely based on guidelines for POPL 2023, with a
few modifications by Derek Dreyer based on discussions with the POPL
Steering Committee. The earlier guidelines evolved from guidelines used
at POPL and PLDI for a number of years, which originated in guidelines
created by Mike Hicks for POPL 2012.
