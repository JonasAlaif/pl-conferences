Call for student volunteers

Sign up to be a Student Volunteer and help us make POPL 2025 a unique
experience for all attendants!

POPL 2025 is pleased to offer a number of opportunities for student
volunteers, who are vital to the efficient operation and continued
success of the conference each year. The student volunteer program is a
chance for students from around the world to participate in the
conferences whilst assisting us in preparing and running the event.

The Student Volunteer Program helps more students attend the POPL
conference by covering registration to the conferences, tutorials,
workshops, and all associated events (but not travel or lodging
expenses). In exchange for a fixed number of work hours (around 15)
helping with the conference organization, you will be able to closely
interact with researchers, mentors, and other students at POPL 2025. We
are looking forward to seeing you in the SV team!

Eligibility

Applicants can be undergraduate, Master’s, Ph.D. full- or part-time
students, of computer science or related fields, with or without
previous experience as volunteers. Everyone is encouraged to apply!

Duration

Applicants must be available for at least four (4) full days between the
19th and 25th of January 2025, and will be expected to provide at least
15 hours of volunteering work in that time. Volunteers will also be
expected to be available for some amount of pre-conference discussion
and training if necessary.

Compensation

Every student volunteer will receive:

-   A complimentary conference registration, offering access to all open
    sessions (i.e., parallel paper presentations, demonstrations, and
    workshops) and conference proceedings.
-   Free lunches and refreshments during breaks.
-   Student volunteer garments.
-   Free admission to all social events.

Please note that Student Volunteers are responsible for their own travel
and accommodation arrangements. However, Student Volunteers can apply
for extra funding from SIGPLAN PAC funding or PLMW when eligible.

You can send questions about student volunteering to sm1@cis.upenn.edu
and s.ayoun17@imperial.ac.uk.

Applications

Apply using: https://forms.gle/E9Scs3UnYE57gbKbA. The form is very short
and won’t take more than 5 minutes to complete. We will NOT evaluate the
applications in a first come first serve order: you will not be
penalised if you want to wait for the POPL conditional acceptance
notification before filling the form.

-   Deadline for submission: Nov 10th, 2025 AoE (notification: Nov 20)
