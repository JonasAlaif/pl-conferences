SUMMARY:[CAV 2018] Paper Submission Deadline
DESCRIPTION:To submit a paper to CAV 2018, authors are expected to upload their full papers by the submission deadline of January 31, 2018. Tool papers require the submission of an artifact together with the paper submission. The submissions will be in two categories: Regular Papers and Tool Papers. Regular Papers should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS format, while Tool Papers should not exceed 6 pages. Authors can include a clearly marked appendix at the end of their submissions that is exempt from the page limit restrictions. Submissions will be made through the EasyChair conference management system, which will open in January 2018. The submission site is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cav2018. As part of the lightweight double-blind review process, authors are expected to make a reasonable effort to anonymize their submissions. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed.
