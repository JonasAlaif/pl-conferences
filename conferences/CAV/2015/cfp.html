<h3>27th International Conference on<br>
<strong>Computer Aided Verification (CAV 2015)</strong><br>
July 18-24 2015, San Francisco, California</h3>
<h3>Aims and Scope</h3>
<p>CAV 2015 is the 27th in a series dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software systems.&nbsp; CAV considers it vital to continue spurring advances in hardware and software verification while expanding to new domains such as biological systems and computer security. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer LNCS series. A selection of papers will be invited to a special issue of Formal Methods in System Design and the Journal of the ACM.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations</li>
<li>Hardware verification techniques</li>
<li>Deductive, compositional, and abstraction techniques for verification</li>
<li>Program analysis and software verification</li>
<li>Verification methods for parallel and concurrent hardware/software systems</li>
<li>Testing and run-time analysis based on verification technology</li>
<li>Applications and case studies in verification</li>
<li>Decision procedures and solvers for verification</li>
<li>Mathematical and logical foundations of practical verification tools</li>
<li>Verification in industrial practice</li>
<li>Algorithms and tools for system synthesis</li>
<li>Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification</li>
<li>Verification techniques for security</li>
<li>Formal models and methods for biological systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paper Submission</h3>
<p>Submissions should contain original research and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. We welcome papers on theory, case studies and comparisons with existing experimental research, tool papers, as well as combinations of new theory with experimental evaluation. Similar to last year, we welcome both <strong>long</strong> tool papers and <strong>short</strong> papers of any kind.</p>
<p>Tool papers should describe system and implementation aspects of a tool with a large (potential) user base (experiments not required, rehash of theory strongly discouraged). Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.</p>
<p>Submissions reporting on case studies in an industrial context are strongly invited, and should describe details, weaknesses, and strengths in sufficient depth. Papers reproducing and comparing existing results experimentally do not require new theoretical insights. Examples of contributions of such papers are evaluations of existing results in a superior experimental setting and comparisons of methods that have not previously been thoroughly experimentally compared.</p>
<p>Papers can be submitted in either a regular or a short format.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Papers</strong> should not exceed <strong>15 pages</strong> in LNCS format, not counting references.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short Papers</strong> should not exceed <strong>6 pages</strong>, not counting references. Short papers are encouraged for any subject that can be described within the page limit, and in particular for novel ideas without an extensive experimental evaluation. Accepted short papers will be accompanied by short presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p>An appendix can provide additional material such as details on proofs or experiments. The appendix is not guaranteed to be read or taken into account by the reviewers and it should not contain information necessary for the understanding and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers will be accepted or rejected in the category in which they were submitted, there will be no “demotions” from a regular to a short paper.</p>
<p>Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed.</p>
<p>The review process will include a <strong>feedback/rebuttal period</strong> where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.</p>
<p>Papers must be submitted in PDF format. Submission is done via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cav2015">EasyChair</a>.</p>
