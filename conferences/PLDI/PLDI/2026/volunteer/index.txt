The application for the Fall 2025- Spring 2026 Bonner cohort is opening
this February to offer students a chance to partake in volunteer
opportunities.

Kimberly Silverio Diaz, Civic Engagement and Experiential Learning
Coordinator in the Civic Engagement and Community Partnerships (CECP)
department, said the Bonner Leader Program is a program where students
are paid for the community service that they do.

She said the Bonner Leader Program – housed at Democracy House – is a
service-based scholarship, and recruitment for the program usually
begins in march. 

According to a provided Bonner program checklist, the deadline to fill
out the Bonner Leader Program application is Aug. 1, and students should
keep close watch on their Middlesex College emails as this is the
Bonners program’s main source of contact with applicants and to schedule
interviews.

Silverio said eligibility requirements for the Bonner program are as
follows: be enrolled for at least 6 credits, be federal work study
eligible and you are a middlesex college student.

She said students can find out if they are federal work study eligible
if they complete their FAFSA application on time – the Federal Student
Aid department would then let students know what financial support
opportunities they are eligible for.

The fourth step is to prepare for your Bonner Program interview when the
time comes, and once accepted, students should email the program’s
administration to confirm you wish to be a Bonner Leader, according to
the checklist.

Then, students must complete and submit hiring paperwork by going to the
College’s Human Resources (HR) department with the necessary
identification and are required to attend Orientation in Raritan Hall on
Aug. 29.

Silverio said that at Orientation students get an overview of the Bonner
Leader Program, learn more about each other, community service sites and
more.

She said at the service site students are expected to do about 10 hours
weekly, and the Bonner program aims to align them with student’s
interests – in regard to their major – or skills that would be helpful
to the community partner they’ll serve.

Alongside receiving community service and financial support
opportunities, Bonner Leaders can partake in workshops, leadership
training, network and connect with other students that are passionate
about the same cause and look to make a difference, she said.

“I feel grateful that there's a program like that at Middlesex College
and that students can take advantage of it,” said Silverio.

Silverio said she is enthusiastic that she gets to play a direct role in
shaping the Bonner program, bring those experiences to students at the
College and assist in making the program something that serves to
benefit students.

She said the goal is to ultimately give students a unique experience
they can carry with them after they transfer to a four-year institution
or go into the workforce.

Xiomara Baca Samaniego, a member of the Bonner Program, said being a
part of it has expanded and shaped her experience at the College.

Samaniego said the Bonner program made her time at the College
interesting, helpful, peaceful and insightful – from the site
experiences and workshops to the members themselves.

Silverio said the Bonner Leader Program currently has 12 students, – an
increase in comparison to the previous Bonner cohort – and their goal is
to recruit 15 students but as long as they have enough funding and
students interested, they can take on more students.

She said the Bonner program also plans service and field trips for
students, so they are planning a trip to Tamerlan Farm this spring.
Where the students will help out, alongside being able to spend a day
learning about the farm, sustainability and global food production.

Some of the Bonner program’s community partners on campus include the
Early Learning Center and Community Resource Hub, in addition to
off-campus partners like the Puerto Rican Action Board, New Brunswick
Free Public Library, the Teen Center and Perth Amboy Success Bound Youth
Leadership Academy program, Silverio said.

She said one of the reasons she encourages students to apply to the
Bonner program is because people can gain a lot out of partaking in
service opportunities without realizing it – people can end up learning
a lot about the community and people they are serving.

She said, “I think that we're always looking to expand our partnerships.
This is where the students get a lot of professional development too.
So, we try to see if we can place them in something that will help
advance their major interest or career.”

Silverio said Democracy House has some events coming up this spring
including a One Billion Rising event near Valentine’s Day, – it’s to
bring awareness to gender-based violence through music, movement, arts
and other creativity ways – alongside a tie dying activity, clothesline
project and display they put up in April, which is Sexual Assult
Awareness Month, for students to learn more about sexual assault
statistics on campus and how to be an ally to survivors. 

For more information about the Bonner Leader Program, contact Kimberly
Silverio Diaz, Civic Engagement and Experiential Learning Coordinator,
at ksilveriodiaz@middlesexcc.edu and Suany Pascale, Coordinator for
Democracy House, at spascale@middlesexcc.edu.

Silverio said there are also some Community Engaged Learning (CEL)
courses still open for students to register for this spring.

According to a provided brochure, CEL connects course content to
real-world needs within the community by addressing social issues in an
interactive way.

Students that take CEL courses get credit for doing volunteer service
hours with a local community partner, and students learn how to connect
those experiences to coursework and reflection, according to the
brochure.

To view the CEL courses, visit “Self Service” here, and you can contact
Jennifer Altman, Service Learning Faculty Coordinator, at
jaltman@middlesexcc.edu or Kimberly Silverio Diaz, Civic Engagement and
Experiential Learning Coordinator, for more information about CEL.
