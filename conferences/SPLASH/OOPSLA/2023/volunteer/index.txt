Volunteers

Sign up to be a Volunteer and help us make SPLASH 2023 a great
experience for all attendants!

SPLASH 2023 is pleased to offer a number of opportunities for
volunteers, who are vital to the efficient operation and continued
success of the conference each year. The volunteer program is a chance
for students and Programming Languages researchers aspirants from around
the world to participate in the conferences whilst assisting us in
preparing and running the event.

The Volunteer Program helps more people attend the SPLASH conference by
covering conference fees, including access to the banquet (but not
travel or lodging expenses) in exchange for a fixed number of work hours
(usually from 12 to 15) helping with the conference organization.

Eligibility

Everyone is welcome to apply. Priority is given to junior members of our
community, e.g. full- or part-time students of computer science and
related fields.

Duration

Applicants must be available for at least five (5) full days between
October 22nd and October 27th 2023, and will be expected to provide
12-15 hours of volunteering work in that time. Volunteers may also be
expected to be available for some amount of pre-conference discussion
and training if necessary. Volunteers from all timezones are welcome.

About Volunteering

The skills, talents, and dedication of our Volunteers contribute to the
overall quality of the conference.

The Volunteer role this year will mainly involve working with the
organizers to prepare for the conference by providing technical
assistance to attendees, managing online Q&A and poster sessions, and
supporting active communication in our online environment.

Volunteering allows you to meet other people (faculty and students) in
the Programming Languages (PL) Community. With several opportunities for
networking, you can share ideas about your research, find topics you are
passionate about, investigate career paths, and even find your future
collaborators!

Compensation

-   A Complimentary Conference Registration, offering access to all open
    sessions (i.e., parallel paper presentations, demonstrations, and
    workshops) and conference proceedings.
-   Free lunches and refreshments during breaks.
-   Volunteer shirt.
-   Free admission to all social events.

Please note that volunteers are responsible for their own travel and
accommodation arrangements.

Virtual and in-person participants are welcome to apply to the
volunteering program. We are looking forward to having you on our team!

If you need additional travel funding, please consider SIGPLAN PAC
Funding and PLMW.

Please send an email to hannelitaa@gmail.com and cgamboa@andrew.cmu.edu
if you have any further questions.
