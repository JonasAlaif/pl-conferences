VolunteersICFP 2024

Sign up to be a Volunteer and help us make ICFP 2024 a unique experience
for all attendants!

ICFP 2024 is pleased to offer a number of opportunities for volunteers,
who are vital to the efficient operation and continued success of the
conference each year. The volunteer program is a chance for people from
around the world to participate in the conferences whilst assisting us
in preparing and running the event.

The Volunteer Program helps more people attend the ICFP conference by
covering conference fees, including access to the banquet (but not
travel or lodging expenses) in exchange for a fixed number of work hours
(usually from 12 to 15) helping with the conference organization.

How to apply

Please apply using this form. The deadline is July 15th.

Eligibility

Everyone is welcome to apply. Priority is given to junior members of our
community, e.g. full- or part-time students of computer science and
related fields.

Expectation

Applicants must be available for at least four (4) full days between
September 2th and September 7th, 2024, and will be expected to provide a
total of 12-15 hours of volunteering work in that time.

The skills, talents, and dedication of our Volunteers contribute to the
overall quality of the conference. The Volunteer role this year will
mainly involve working with the organizers to prepare for the conference
by providing technical assistance to attendees, managing online Q&A and
poster sessions, and supporting active communication in our online
environment.

Compensation

-   A Complimentary Conference Registration, offering access to all open
    sessions (i.e., parallel paper presentations, demonstrations, and
    workshops) and conference proceedings.
-   Free lunches and refreshments during breaks.
-   Volunteer garments.
-   Free admission to all social events.

Please note that volunteers are responsible for their own travel and
accommodation arrangements.

If you need additional travel funding, please consider SIGPLAN PAC
Funding and PLMW.
